# BURNOUT
**About the game:**<br>
BURNOUT is an immersive storytelling game about experiencing burn-out. It is constructed from several mini-games that flow together in one narrative.
<br>
Long ago, the match people lived in warmth and comfort in their city. That is, until one match-person dissolved in a bright blaze of flames, the entire city turning into an inferno with them. The survivors snuffed out their own flames and huddled in the cold. Now they need you, brave match-child, to show them once again how to live with the flame without being consumed.

4. **Social Distancing**<br>
Style:<br>
Top-Down<br>

Side Scroller<br>
Goal:<br>
To relight the flame. Once the player achieves this, they will go back to the first mini-game.<br>

Player is infernoing on an ice surface. The surface cracks, they fall through, the flame goes out, the screen goes dark, we revert to text-based game-play. Player hears the sound of a crackling fireplace, text tells them to navigate towards it. Once the player reaches the 'fire' which probably will be relatively easy, their flame relights.
